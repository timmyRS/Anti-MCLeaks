# Anti MCLeaks

Want to stop MCLeaks users from joining your server?

- On **BungeeCord** you can simply set `prevent_proxy_connections` to `true`
- On **Vanilla** you can simply set the `prevent-proxy-connections` option to `true`
	- If the vanilla option doesn't seem to work on your **Spigot** server, the [SayNoToMCLeaks](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/saynotomcleaks.40906/) plugin might help

... and after a restart MCLeaks users should no longer be able to join. :)
